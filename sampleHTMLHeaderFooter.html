            <p class="date">Posted on May 27 2019</p>
            <p class="main-text">
                In this article, I have included a whole load of blog examples from a wide variety of different niches.
                Since the beginning of the internet, millions and millions and millions of blogs have been created. Many
                have died due to lost interest or their owners giving up on the idea, while others have thrived and
                continue
                to grow, making money and earning their owners a steady income. It’s a constant evolution of content
                that
                keeps people coming back for more, especially if these blogs contact highly resourceful material that
                people
                find useful and interesting.
                Each example listed in this blog post are all different in some way and all bring something unique to
                their
                readers & subscribers. I want to show you what is possible and how you can take inspiration from them
                and
                create an awesome blog of your own.
                Some of these blogs make over $100k a month, others are just a hobby for their owners, but all have the
                same
                purpose at their core the love of writing and sharing information.
